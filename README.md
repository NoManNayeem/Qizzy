# Qizzy is a React Native Expo Boilerplate App with Authentication

This is a boilerplate React Native Expo app created using the `npx create-expo-app appname` command. It comes with authentication features pre-activated to help you get started with building secure mobile applications.

## Features

- **Authentication**: The app includes a user authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in, and reset their passwords securely.

- **Navigation**: It incorporates a navigation system to help you organize and navigate between different screens and features.

- **UI Components**: You'll find a collection of pre-designed UI components that you can use as building blocks for your app's user interface.
- 
- **Customizable**: You can easily customize and extend the app to meet your specific requirements. Add new screens, features, or integrate with external APIs as needed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the app repository to your local development environment.

2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

3. Set up your authentication system, configure the navigation, and connect to your database of choice as needed.

4. Start the development server with `npx expo start` to start with Expo Go or Locally with ADB.

5. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code generated by the development server to preview the app.

6. Begin building and customizing your app by adding your own code and design elements.

## Dependencies

This app relies on various dependencies and libraries to provide the authentication and navigation features. Some of the key dependencies include:

- `react-native`: The core framework for building mobile applications with React.

- `expo`: A set of tools and libraries that simplify React Native development.
